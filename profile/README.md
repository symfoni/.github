## Our Impactful Initiatives

At Symfoni, we strategically align technology with business goals, amplifying the impact of our initiatives across various domains:

### **üìà BR√òK**: Transforming Norway's Business Landscape
In partnership with The Br√∏nn√∏ysund Register Centre, we are revolutionizing the way businesses are registered in Norway. Our key creation, **BR√òK**, is an unprecedented captable platform for unlisted companies, facilitating transparency and efficiency. Discover more about this transformational project [here](https://beta.brreg.no/forside/brok/), and explore the code [here](https://github.com/brreg/brok).

### **üè¶ CBDC Development**: Leading the Future of Finance
We have been instrumental in developing key features such as Stealth transactions (detailed in this insightful [blog post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2023/01/20/stealth.html) by Vitalik Buterin), Verifiable credentials, max limits, and continuous interest calculation for [the Norwegian Bank CBDC](https://github.com/norges-bank/cbdc-sandbox-contracts).
