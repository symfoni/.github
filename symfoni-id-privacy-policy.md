**Privacy Policy for Symfoni ID**

**Introduction**

Symfoni AS ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of users ("you") of our Symfoni ID app ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information in connection with your use of the App.

**1. Data Collection and Usage**

a) **Information We Do Not Collect**: We do not collect, store, or process any personal information, including details contained within your Offer of Employment, on our servers or through our company. The Offer of Employment is downloaded to the App as signed credentials, and all such information remains solely in your possession and control.

b) **No Other Data Collection**: Symfoni ID does not collect any additional data, including device or usage information.

**2. Data Sharing with Third-Party Websites**

a) **User-Controlled Sharing**: The App itself does not share any information. However, you may choose to connect the App with a website, at which point that website can request data from the App. Any sharing of information with third-party websites is entirely under your control and initiated by you.

**3. No Tracking**

We do not use any tracking technologies, cookies, or similar technologies within the App.

**4. Security Measures**

Symfoni ID is part of a pilot project and has been developed with the goal of facilitating the process of downloading and presenting the Offer of Employment as signed credentials for immigration to Norway. While we have taken measures to ensure the functionality of the App, please be aware that it has been developed rapidly as part of an experimental initiative.

Although we do not access or store any information ourselves, we encourage users to exercise caution and follow best practices in safeguarding their information. Users are responsible for the secure management of their own credentials within the App.

We welcome feedback and will strive to address any reported concerns promptly.

**5. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
